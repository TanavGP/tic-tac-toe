gameboard
player(name)
robot(name=robot, accuracy)

getPlayerMove()
getAIMove()
// gets the best possible move and plays that (accuracy)% of the time, otherwise plays random move 
checkGameEnd() needs access to gameboard
// checks if game has ended the turn it was called after, returns
// three different values: draw, xwin, ywin
minmax()
// is called by getAIMove() and recursively finds the best move 


player will select mode
X will automatically go first
maybe ask player for custom name
